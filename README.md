# OOT-Rando Notes with store2 (localStorage)
Simple app for writing notes about oot-rando seeds.

It's using [store2](https://github.com/nbubna/store) to store all notes locally in your browser.
[Simple.css](https://simplecss.org/) for styling.

With every input it saves all text you've typed so you can close/refresh the page and the text is still there. Just hit the 'Reset All'-button to clear everything.
